# DL-Examples
This repo stores examples of deep learning in jupyter note files. 

This repo may help you remind how to use    
{     
  ml: sklearn,         
  dl: cv2 (openCV), tensorflow
}      

Currently, I'm working on trimming some jupyter notebook files...       
Examples using sklearn, tensorflow will be soon updated.
